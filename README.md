Science Unlimited Summer Camp @utoronto was a math and science summer camp for students ranging from elementary to high school. My fellow classmates and I had the opportunity to create educational math and science games under the supervision of Professor Steve Engels to teach certain concepts or material.

Griddy Golf is a math-based game that I coded to teach the camp students different angles (acute, obtuse, etc.) and the triangular shapes related to those angles. There is a tutorial level, and 3 regular levels.

I have included the source code and assets used for the project.
The final build is found in the directory \Build for Linux (32-bit), Windows (32-bit) and Mac OS (64-bit).
