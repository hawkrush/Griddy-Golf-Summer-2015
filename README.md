\f0\fs24 \cf0 \'93Science Unlimited Summer Camp @utoronto\'94 was a math and science summer camp for students ranging from elementary to high school. My fellow classmates and I had the opportunity to create educational math and/or science games \'97 under the supervision of Professor Steve Engels \'97 to teach these students certain concepts or material.\
\'97\'97\'97\'97\
Griddy Golf is a math-based game that I coded to teach the camp students different angles (acute, obtuse, etc.) and the triangular shapes related to those angles.\
\
There is a tutorial level, and 3 regular levels.\
\'97\'97\'97\'97\
I have included the source code and assets used for the project.\
The final build is found in the directory \'91Build\'92, for Linux (32-bit), Windows (32-bit) and Mac OS (64-bit)}
